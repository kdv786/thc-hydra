        CHANGELOG for 7.6
        ===================
        * Added a wizard script for hydra based on a script by Shivang Desai <shivang.ice.2010@gmail.com>
        * Added module for Siemens S7-300 (submitted by Alexander Timorin and Sergey Gordeychik, thanks!)
        * HTTP HEAD/GET: MD5 digest auth was not working, fixed (thanks to Paul Kenyon)
        * SMTP Enum: HELO is now always sent, better 500 error detection
        * hydra main:
           - fixed a bug in the IPv6 address parsing when a port was supplied
           - added info message for pop3, imap and smtp protocol usage
        * hydra GTK: missed some services, added
        * dpl4hydra.sh:
           - added Siemens S7-300 common passwords to default password list
           - more broad searching in the list
        * Performed code indention on all C files :-)
        * Makefile patch to ensure .../etc directory is there (thanks to vonnyfly)

 [0x01] Introduction

	Welcome to the mini website of the THC Hydra project.

	Number one of the biggest security holes are passwords, as every password security study shows.
	Hydra is a parallized login cracker which supports numerous protocols to attack. New modules
	are easy to add, beside that, it is flexible and very fast.

        Hydra was tested to compile on Linux, Windows/Cygwin, Solaris 11, FreeBSD 8.1 and OSX, and
        is made available under GPLv3 with a special OpenSSL license expansion.

	Currently this tool supports:
	  Asterisk, AFP, Cisco AAA, Cisco auth, Cisco enable, CVS, Firebird, FTP, HTTP-FORM-GET, HTTP-FORM-POST,
	  HTTP-GET, HTTP-HEAD, HTTP-PROXY, HTTPS-FORM-GET, HTTPS-FORM-POST, HTTPS-GET, HTTPS-HEAD,
	  HTTP-Proxy, ICQ, IMAP, IRC, LDAP, MS-SQL, MYSQL, NCP, NNTP, Oracle Listener, Oracle SID, Oracle,
	  PC-Anywhere, PCNFS, POP3, POSTGRES, RDP, Rexec, Rlogin, Rsh, S7-300, SAP/R3, SIP, SMB, SMTP, SMTP Enum,
	  SNMP, SOCKS5, SSH (v1 and v2), Subversion, Teamspeak (TS2), Telnet, VMware-Auth, VNC and XMPP.

        For HTTP, POP3, IMAP and SMTP, several login mechanisms like plain and MD5 digest etc. are supported.

	This tool is a proof of concept code, to give researchers and security consultants the 
	possiblity to show how easy it would be to gain unauthorized access from remote to a system.

        The program is maintained by van Hauser and David Maciejak.


 [0x02] Documentation 
 
	Hydra comes with a rather long <a href="README">README file</a> that describes the
	details about the usage and special options.
	
	But sometimes detailed online help can vastly improve your efficency.
	The following links on the global internet are a recommended read.

        For those people testing with <a href="http://www.dvwa.co.uk/">DVWA</a>, this is what you want:

 [0x03] Compilation Help

        Hydry compiles fine on all platforms that have gcc - Linux, all BSD, Mac OS/X, Cygwin on Windows, Solaris, etc.
        It should even compile on historical SunOS, Ultrix etc. platforms :-)
        
        There are many optional modules for network protocols like SSH, SVN etc. that require libraries.
        If they are not found, these optional libraries will not be supported in your binary.
        
        If you are on Linux, the following commands install all necessary libraries:
 
        Ubuntu/Debian:  apt-get install libssl-dev libssh-dev libidn11-dev libpcre3-dev libgtk2.0-dev libmysqlclient-dev libpq-dev libsvn-dev firebird2.1-dev libncp-dev libncurses5-dev
        Redhat/Fedora:  yum install openssl-devel pcre-devel ncpfs-devel postgresql-devel libssh-devel subversion-devel libncurses-devel
        OpenSuSE:       zypper install libopenssl-devel pcre-devel libidn-devel ncpfs-devel libssh-devel postgresql-devel subversion-devel libncurses-devel
        
        This enables all optional modules and features with the exception of Oracle, SAP R/3 and the
        Apple filing protocol - which you will need to download and install from the vendor's web sites.
        For Oracle this is (install the basic and SDK packages): <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/database/features/instant-client/index.html">http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/database/features/instant-client/index.html</a>

        For all other Linux derivates and BSD based systems, use the system software installer and look for
        similar named libraries like in the command above.
        In all other cases you have to download all source libraries and compile them manually; 
        the configure script output tells you what is missing and where to get it from.
        

 [0x04] Disclaimer

	1. This tool is for legal purposes only!
	2. The Affero General Public License Version 3 (AGPLv3) applies to this code.
	3. A special license expansion for OpenSSL is included which is required for the Debian people


 [0x05] Development &amp; Contributions

	Your contributions are more than welcomed!
	
	If you find bugs, coded enhancements or wrote a new attack module for a service,
	please send them to vh (at) thc (dot) org

	Interesting attack modules would be:
	OSPF, BGP, PIM, PPTP, ...
	(or anything else you might be able to do (and is not there yet))

 [0x07] The Art of Downloading: Source and Binaries
 
	1. The source code of state-of-the-art Hydra: <a href="http://www.thc.org/releases/hydra-7.6.tar.gz">hydra-7.6.tar.gz</a>
	   (compiles on all UNIX based platforms - even MacOS X, Cygwin on Windows, ARM-Linux, Android, etc.)

	2. The source code of an old, deprecated version of Hydra <b>ONLY in case v7.x gives you problems</b> on unusual and old platforms:
	   <a href="http://www.thc.org/releases/hydra-5.9.1-src.tar.gz">hydra-5.9.1-src.tar.gz</a>

	3. The Win32/Cywin binary release: --- not anymore ---
	   Install cygwin from <a href="http://www.cygwin.com/">http://www.cygwin.com</a>
	   and compile it yourself. If you do not have cygwin installed - how
	   do you think you will do proper securiy testing? duh ...

        4. ARM and Palm binaries here are old and not longer maintained:
	     ARM:  <a href="http://www.thc.org/thc-hydra/hydra-5.0-arm.tar.gz">hydra-5.0-arm.tar.gz</a>
             Palm: <a href="http://www.thc.org/thc-hydra/hydra-4.6-palm.zip">hydra-4.6-palm.zip</a>


 Comments and suggestions are welcome.

 Yours sincerly,
