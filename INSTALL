type "./configure", then "make" and finally "sudo make install"

For special modules you need to install software packages before
you run "./configure":
  Ubuntu/Debian:  apt-get install libssl-dev libssh-dev libidn11-dev libpcre3-dev libgtk2.0-dev libmysqlclient-dev libpq-dev libsvn-dev firebird-dev libncurses5-dev
  Redhat/Fedora:  yum install openssl-devel pcre-devel ncpfs-devel postgresql-devel libssh-devel subversion-devel libncurses-devel
  OpenSuSE:       zypper install libopenssl-devel pcre-devel libidn-devel ncpfs-devel libssh-devel postgresql-devel subversion-devel libncurses-devel


###  Note:

Due to the Android file system, the installation on it is different, please follow these steps:

```
# Necessary dependencies
pkg install -y x11-repo
pkg install -y clang make openssl openssl-tool wget openssh coreutils gtk2 gtk3
# Compiling hydra
./configure --prefix=$PREFIX
make
make install
```

To use xhydra, you will need to install a graphical output in termux, you can be guided from [this article](https://wiki.termux.com/wiki/Graphical_Environment)
